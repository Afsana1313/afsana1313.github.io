        I’m a developer passionate about crafting accessible, pixel-perfect user
        interfaces that blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. My
        favorite work lies at the intersection of design and development,
        creating experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built
        for performance and usability. Currently, I am a Senior Front-End
        Engineer at Klaviyo, specializing in accessibility. I contribute to the
        creation and maintenance of UI components that power Klaviyo’s frontend,
        ensuring our platform meets web accessibility standards and best
        practices to deliver an inclusive user experience. In the past, I have
        had the opportunity to develop software across a variety of settings —
        from advertising agencies and large corporations to start-ups and small
        digital product studios. Additionally, I also released a comprehensive
        video course a few years ago, guiding learners through building a web
        app with the Spotify API. In my spare time, I’m usually climbing,
        reading, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or running around Hyrule
